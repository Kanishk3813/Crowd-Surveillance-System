# Crowd Surveillance System

## Overview

This project was developed for the Prayagraj Mahakumbh Hackathon 2025, with a focus on crowd surveillance. In large-scale events like the Mahakumbh, ensuring the safety and security of attendees is paramount. Our system utilizes advanced computer vision techniques to monitor crowd behavior, detect anomalies, and identify potential hazards in real-time. By providing event organizers and security personnel with valuable insights, we aim to enhance crowd management and improve overall safety measures.

## Features

- **Crowd Counting:** Accurately counts heads within crowded spaces, aiding event organizers and security personnel in crowd management. This feature provides real-time data on crowd density, helping organizers make informed decisions to prevent overcrowding and ensure the safety of attendees.
  
- **Anomaly Detection:** Utilizes machine learning algorithms to identify anomalies within crowds, enabling real-time detection of suspicious behavior for proactive intervention. Whether it's detecting individuals moving against the flow of the crowd or identifying abandoned objects, this feature helps security teams identify potential threats and take timely action.

- **Fire Detection:** Integrated fire detection capabilities allow for the rapid identification of fire hazards within crowded areas, mitigating risks and ensuring the safety of attendees. By leveraging image processing and deep learning techniques, our system can detect flames or smoke in the early stages, enabling prompt evacuation and firefighting measures.

## Installation
